## Project Description
The project are for experimenting the performance of modifed NLP approaches
1. hypercomplex classifer from pre-trained RoBERT, aiming at
   - More sensitive classifer than original fully-connected classifer
   - More light-weight model sturcture, and comparative performance as original classifer does
2. GPT text augmentation with pos-tagging, aiming at
   - Optimiziing previous work from [Data Augmentation Using Pre-trained Transformer Models](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lifelongnlp-1.3.pdf)
## Technologies
Technique : 
* Hypercomplex classifer implemented in pre-trained RoBERT model
* GPT augmentation with Pos-tagging
* SASrec sequential recommendation system
